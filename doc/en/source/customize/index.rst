(For developers) User-defined algorithms and solvers
================================================================

``py2dmat`` solves the inverse problems by the combination of ``Solver`` for the direct problems and ``Algorithm`` for the optimization methods.
Instead of using ``Solver`` and ``Algorithm`` provided by ``py2dmat``, users can define and use their own components.
In this chapter, how to define ``Solver`` and ``Algorithm`` and to use them will be described.
