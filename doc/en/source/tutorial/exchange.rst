Optimization by replica exchange Monte Carlo
================================================

This tutorial describes how to estimate the minimization problem of Himmelblau function by using the replica exchange Monte Carlo method (RXMC).

Sample files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample files are available from ``sample/analytical/exchange`` .
This directory includes the following files:

- ``input.toml``

  The input file of py2dmat

- ``do.sh``

  Script files for running this tutorial


Input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subsection describes the input file.
For details, see the input file section of the manual.

.. code-block::

  [base]
  dimension = 2
  output_dir = "output"

  [solver]
  name = "analytical"
  function_name = "himmelblau"

  [algorithm]
  name = "exchange"
  seed = 12345

  [algorithm.param]
  min_list = [3.0, 3.0]
  max_list = [6.0, 6.0]
  initial_list = [0.0, 0.0]
  unit_list = [0.3, 0.3]

  [algorithm.exchange]
  Tmin = 0.1
  Tmax = 10.0
  numsteps = 10000
  numsteps_exchange = 100
  nreplica_per_proc = 20


In the following, we will briefly describe this input file.
For details, see the manual of :doc:`../algorithm/exchange`.

The contents of ``[base]``, ``[solver]``, and ``[runner]`` sections are the same as those for the search by the Nelder-Mead method (``minsearch``).

``[algorithm]`` section specifies the algorithm to use and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use. In this tutorial we will use RXMC, so specify ``exchange``.

- ``seed`` is the seed that a pseudo-random number generator uses.

``[algorithm.param]`` section sets the parameter space to be explored.

- ``min_list`` is a lower bound and ``max_list`` is an upper bound.

- ``initial_list`` is an initial value.

- ``unit_list`` is the unit of each parameter.

``[algorithm.exchange]`` section sets the hyper parameters for RXMC.

- ``numstep`` is the number of Monte Carlo steps.

- ``numsteps_exchange`` is the number of steps between temperature exchanges.

- ``Tmin``, ``Tmax`` are the minimum and the maximum of temperature, respectively.

- When ``Tlogspace`` is ``true``, the temperature points are distributed uniformly in the logarithmic space.

- ``nreplica_per_proc`` specifies the number of replicas that one MPI process handles.
  

Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample file is located. (Hereinafter, it is assumed that you are the root directory of 2DMAT.)

.. code-block::

   $ cd sample/analytical/exchange

Then, run the main program. It will take a few secondes on a normal PC.

.. code-block::

   $ mpiexec -np 4 python3 ../../../src/py2dmat_main.py input.toml | tee log.txt


Here, the calculation is performed using MPI parallel with 4 processes.
If you are using Open MPI and you request more processes than the number of cores, you need to add the ``--oversubscribed`` option to the ``mpiexec`` command.

When executed, a folder for each MPI rank will be created under ``output`` directory, and a ``trial.txt`` file containing the parameters evaluated in each Monte Carlo step and the value of the objective function, and a ``result.txt`` file containing the parameters actually adopted will be created.

These files have the same format: the first two columns are time (step) and the index of walker in the process, the third is the temperature, the fourth column is the value of the objective function, and the fifth and subsequent columns are the parameters.

.. code-block::

    # step walker T fx x1 x2

    ...

``best_result.txt`` is filled with information about the parameter with the optimal objective function, the rank from which it was obtained, and the Monte Carlo step.

.. code-block::

    nprocs = 80
    rank = 3
    step = 8025
    walker = 17
    fx = 3.358076734724385e-06
    x1 = 2.9998063442504126
    x2 = 1.999754886043102


In 2DMAT, one replica holds samples at different temperatures because of the temperature exchanges. The ``result.txt`` in each rank folder records the data sampled by each replica.
The data reorganized for each temperature point is written to ``output/result_T%.txt``, where ``%`` is the index of the temperature point.
The first column is the step, the second column is the rank, the third column is the value of the objective function, and the fourth and subsequent columns are the parameters.
Example:

.. code-block::

    # T = 0.014187266741165962
    0 3 108.25464277273859 0.8127003489802398 1.1465364357510186

    ...


Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By plotting ``output/result_T%.txt``, you can estimate regions where the parameters with small function values are located.
By executing the following command, the figures of two-dimensional plot ``res_T%.png`` will be generated.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 ../plot_himmel.py --xcol=3 --ycol=4 --skip=20 --format="o" --output=output/res_T0.png output/result_T0.txt

Looking at the resulting diagram, we can see that the samples are concentrated near the minima of ``f(x)``. By changing the index of the temperature, the sampling points scatters over the region at high temperature, while they tend to concentrate on the minima at low temperature.
