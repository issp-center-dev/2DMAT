Optimization by Bayesian Optimization
========================================

This tutorial describes how to estimate the minimization problem of Himmelblau function by using Bayesian optimization (BO).
2DMAT uses `PHYSBO <https://www.pasums.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/physbo/en>`_ for BO.
PHYSBO package should be installed beforehand.

Sample files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample files are available from ``sample/analytical/bayes`` .
This directory includes the following files:

- ``input.toml``

  The input file of py2dmat

- ``do.sh``

  Script files for running this tutorial

In addition, ``plot_himmel.py`` in ``sample`` directory is used to visualize the result.
  

Input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subsection describes the input file.
For details, see :ref:`the manual of bayes <bayes_input>`.

.. code-block::

    [base]
    dimension = 2
    output_dir = "output"

    [solver]
    name = "analytical"
    function_name = "himmelblau"

    [algorithm]
    name = "bayes"
    seed = 12345

    [algorithm.param]
    min_list = [-6.0, -6.0]
    max_list = [ 6.0,  6.0]
    num_list = [61, 61]

    [algorithm.bayes]
    random_max_num_probes = 20
    bayes_max_num_probes = 40


The contents of ``[base]``, ``[solver]``, and ``[runner]`` sections are the same as those for the search by the Nelder-Mead method (``minsearch``).

``[algorithm]`` section specifies the algorithm to use and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use, and in this tutorial we will do a Bayesian optimization analysis, so specify ``bayes``.

- ``seed`` specifies the initial input of random number generator.

``[algorithm.param]`` section specifies the range of parameters to search and their initial values.

- ``min_list`` and ``max_list`` specify the minimum and maximum values of the search grid, respectively.

- ``num_list`` specifies the number of grid points along each parameter.
  
``[algorithm.bayes]`` section sets the parameters for Bayesian optimization.

- ``random_max_num_probes`` specifies the number of random searches before Bayesian optimization.

- ``bayes_max_num_probes`` specifies the number of Bayesian searches.

For details on other parameters that can be specified in the input file, see the chapter on input files of ``bayes``.


Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample file is located. (Hereinafter, it is assumed that you are the root directory of 2DMAT.)

.. code-block::

   $ cd sample/analytical/bayes

Then, run the main program. It will take a few secondes on a normal PC.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 ../../../src/py2dmat_main.py input.toml | tee log.txt

By executing the program, a directory with the name ``0`` is created under ``output`` directory, and the results are written in it.
The following standard output will be shown:

.. code-block::

  # parameter
  random_max_num_probes = 10
  bayes_max_num_probes = 20
  score = TS
  interval = 5
  num_rand_basis = 5000
  value_01 =  5.10000
  value_02 =  4.90000
  R-factor = 0.037237314010261195
  0001-th step: f(x) = -0.037237 (action=150)
     current best f(x) = -0.037237 (best action=150)

  value_01 =  4.30000
  value_02 =  3.50000
  ...

A list of hyperparameters, followed by candidate parameters at each step and the corresponding function values are shown first.
It also outputs the grid index (``action``) and ``f(x)`` of the best value at that time.
The final estimated parameters are output to ``output/BayesData.txt``.

In this case, ``BayesData.txt`` can be seen as the following

.. code-block::

   ...


The first column contains the number of steps, and the second, third, and fourth columns contain ``x2``, ``x2``, and ``f(x)``, which give the highest score at that time.
This is followed by the candidate ``x1``, ``x2`` and ``f(x)`` for that step.
In this case, you can see that the correct solution is obtained at the 41st step.


Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can see at what step the parameter gave the minimum score by looking at ``BayesData.txt``.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 ../plot_himmel.py --xcol=1 --ycol=2 --format="-o" --output=output/res.pdf output/BayesData.txt
   $ python3 ../plot_himmel.py --xcol=4 --ycol=5 --format="o" --output=output/actions.pdf output/BayesData.txt

By executing the above commands, ``output/actions.pdf`` and ``output/res.pdf`` will be created that plots the grid points evaluated during the Bayes optimization process, and the sequence of the points that yield the least scores, respectively, on top of the contour of Himmelblau function.

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/res_bayes_actions.*

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/res_bayes.*

   The grid points evaluated during the Bayesian optimization and the history of points that yield the least scores.
