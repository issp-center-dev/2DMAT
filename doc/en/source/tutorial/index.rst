Tutorials
==================================

In these tutorials, how to perform inverse problem analyses using 2DMAT is explained by examples taken from minimization of analytical functions.
In 2DMAT, the algorithms for solving the inverse problem can be selected from the following algorithms:

- ``minsearch``

   Nealder-Mead method.

- ``mapper_mpi``

   Entire search over a grid for a given parameter.

- ``bayes``

   Bayesian optimization.

- ``exchange``

   Sampling by the replica exchange Monte Carlo method.

- ``pamc``

   Sampling by the population annealing Monte Carlo method.

In the following sections, the procedures to run these algorithms are provided.
In addition, the usage of ``[runner.limitation]`` to apply limitations to the search region will be described. In the end of the section, how to define a direct problem solver wil be explained by a simple example.
