Optimization by Nelder-Mead method
====================================

In this section, we will explain how to calculate the minimization problem of Himmelblau function using the Nelder-Mead method.
The specific calculation procedure is as follows.

1. Preparation of an input file

   Prepare an input file that describes parameters in TOML format.

2. Run the main program

   Run the calculation using ``src/py2dmat_main.py`` to solve the minimization problem.


Location of the sample files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample files are located in ``sample/analytical/minsearch``.
The following files are stored in the folder.

- ``input.toml``

  Input file of the main program.

- ``do.sh``

  Script prepared for doing all calculation of this tutorial

In addition, ``plot_himmel.py`` in the ``sample`` folder is used to visualize the result.
  

Input file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will prepare the input file ``input.toml`` for the main program.
The details of ``input.toml`` can be found in the ``input file`` section of the manual.

.. code-block::

    [base]
    dimension = 2
    output_dir = "output"

    [solver]
    name = "analytical"
    function_name = "himmelblau"

    [runner]
    [runner.log]
    interval = 20
    
    [algorithm]
    name = "minsearch"
    seed = 12345

    [algorithm.param]
    min_list = [-6.0, -6.0]
    max_list = [ 6.0,  6.0]
    initial_list = [0, 0]


``[base]`` section describes parameters used in the whole program.

- ``dimension`` is the number of variables to be optimized, in this case ``2`` since Himmelblau function is a two-variable function.

- ``output_dir`` is the name of directory for output.

  
``[solver]`` section specifies the solver to be used inside the main program and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the solver you want to use. In this tutorial, we perform analyses of an analytical function in the ``analytical`` solver.

- ``function_name`` is the name of the function in the ``analytical`` solver.

``[runner]`` section specifies settings on calling the direct problem solver from the inverse problem analysis algorithm.

- ``interval`` in ``[runner.log]`` specifies the frequency of the log output. The logs are written in every ``interval`` steps.

``[algorithm]`` section specifies the algorithm to use and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use. In this tutorial we will use ``minsearch`` since we will be using the Nelder-Mead method.

- ``seed`` specifies the initial input of random number generator.

``[algorithm.param]`` section specifies the range of parameters to search and their initial values.

- ``min_list`` and ``max_list`` specify the minimum and maximum values of the search range, respectively.

- ``initial_list`` specifies the initial values.

Other parameters, such as convergence judgments used in the Nelder-Mead method, can be done in the ``[algorithm]`` section, although they are omitted here because the default values are used.
See the input file chapter for details.

Calculation execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample files are located. (We assume that you are directly under the directory where you downloaded this software.)

.. code-block::

   $ cd sample/analytical/minsearch

Then, run the main program. The computation time takes only a few seconds on a normal PC.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 ../../../src/py2dmat_main.py input.toml | tee log.txt

The standard output will be seen as follows.

.. code-block::

    Optimization terminated successfully.
             Current function value: 0.000000
             Iterations: 40
             Function evaluations: 79
    iteration: 40
    len(allvecs): 41
    step: 0
    allvecs[step]: [0. 0.]
    step: 1
    allvecs[step]: [0.375 0.375]
    step: 2
    allvecs[step]: [0.0625 0.9375]
    step: 3
    allvecs[step]: [0.65625 1.46875]
    step: 4
    allvecs[step]: [0.328125 2.859375]
    ...

The ``x1`` and ``x2`` are the candidate parameters at each step and the function value at that point.
The final estimated parameters is written to ``output/res.dat``. 
In the current case, the following result will be obtained:

.. code-block::

    fx = 4.2278370361994904e-08
    x1 = 2.9999669562950175
    x2 = 1.9999973389336225

It is seen that one of the minima is obtained.    

Visualization of calculation results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps taken during the search by the Nelder-Mead method is written in ``output/SimplexData.txt``. A tool to plot the path is prepared as ``simplex/plot_himmel.py``.

.. code-block::

    $ python3 ../plot_himmel.py --xcol=1 --ycol=2 --output=output/res.pdf output/SimplexData.txt

By executing the above command, ``output/res.pdf`` will be generated.

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/res_minsearch.*

   The path taken during the minimum search by the Nelder-Mead method is drawn by the blue line. The black curves show contour of Himmelblau function.

The path of the minimum search by the Nelder-Mead method is drawn on top of the contour plot of Himmelblau function. Starting from the initial value at ``(0, 0)``, the path reaches to one of the minima, ``(3, 2)``.
