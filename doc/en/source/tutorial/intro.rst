Himmelblau function
============================

As an example of direct problem solver, the minimization of Himmelblau function among the Analytical solver included in 2DMAT will be discussed in these tutorials.
The Himmelblau function is a two-variable function given as follows, having multiple number of minima. It is used as a benchmark for the evaluation of optimization algorithms.

.. math::

   f(x,y) = (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2

The minimum value :math:`f(x,y)=0` is given at :math:`(x,y)` that equals to :math:`(3.0, 2.0)`, :math:`(-2.805118, 3.131312)`, :math:`(-3.779310, -3.283186)`, and :math:`(3.584428, -1.848126)`.
