The development of 2DMAT was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 19H04125 "Unification of computational statistics and measurement technology by massively parallel machine"
and "Project for advancement of software usability in materials science" of The Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo.
A part of the design of and naming in software is inspired by `abics <https://github.com/issp-center-dev/abics>`_
For the implementation of the forward problem solver,
we thank to T. Hanada (Tohoku Univ.), I. Mochizuki (KEK), W. Voegeli (Tokyo Gakugei Univ.), T. Shirasawa(AIST), R. Ahmed (Kyushu Univ.), and K. Wada(KEK). For adding a tutorial for customizing solver, we thank to K. Tsukamoto (ISSP).
