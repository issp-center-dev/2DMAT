What is 2DMAT ?
--------------------------------

2DMAT is a framework for applying a search algorithm to a direct problem solver to find the optimal solution.
As the standard direct problem solver, the experimental data analysis software for two-dimensional material structure analysis is prepared.
The direct problem solver gives the deviation between the experimental data and the calculated data obtained under the given parameters such as atomic positions as a loss function used in the inverse problem.
The optimal parameters are estimated by minimizing the loss function using a search algorithm. For further use, the original direct problem solver or the search algorithm can be defined by users.
In the current version, for solving a direct problem, 2DMAT offers the wrapper of the solver for the total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction (TRHEPD), the surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD), and the low-energy electron diffraction (LEED).
As algorithms, it offers the Nelder-Mead method, the grid search method, the Bayesian optimization method, the replica exchange Monte Carlo method, and the population annealing Monte Carlo method.


What is 2DMAT-LEED ?
--------------------------------

``SATLEED`` is a software package developed by M.A. Van Hove for the analyses of LEED, which calculates the Rocking curve from the atomic positions and other parameters, and evaluate the deviations from the Rocking curve obtained from the experiments.
2DMAT-LEED is an adaptor library to use SATLEED as a direct problem solver of 2DMAT.
It was originally developed as a component of 2DMAT v2.x, and has been restructured as a separate module to be used with 2DMAT and SATLEED.
For more information on ``SATLEED``, see [SATLEED]_.
