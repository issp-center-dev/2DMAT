Optimization by Grid search
================================================================

In this section, we will explain how to perform a grid-type search to analyze atomic coordinates from diffraction data.
The grid type search is compatible with MPI.
It is necessary to prepare the data file ``MeshData.txt`` that defines the search grid in advance.


Location of the sample files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample files are located in ``sample/mapper``.
The following files are stored in the folder:

- ``base`` directory

  Directory that contains reference files to proceed with calculations in the main program.
  The reference files include: ``exp.d``, ``rfac.d``, ``short.t``, ``tleed.o``, ``tleed4.i``, and ``tleed5.i``.

- ``input.toml``

  Input file of the main program.

- ``MeshData.txt``

  Data file for the search grid.
  
- ``ref_ColorMap.txt``

  A file to check if the calculation was performed correctly (the answer to ``ColorMap.txt`` obtained by doing this tutorial).

- ``prepare.sh``, ``do.sh``

  Script prepared for bulk calculation of this tutorial.

Below, we will describe these files and then show the actual calculation results.


Reference files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tleed4.i``, ``tleed5.i``, and ``rfac.d`` are the parameter files for satleed.
The atomic coordinates to be optimized should be replaced by the keywords such as ``opt000`` or ``opt001`` in ``tleed4.i``.
``exp.d`` is the reference experimental data.
``short.t`` and ``tleed.o`` are the input data that have been generated by using ``satl1.exe``.

The search grid is given by ``MeshData.txt``.
In this tutorial, the content of ``MeshData.txt`` is as follows:

.. code-block::

    0 -0.1   0 
    1 -0.05  0
    2 0      0
    3 0.05   0
    4 0.1    0
    5 -0.1   0.05
    6 -0.05  0.05
    7 0      0.05
    8 0.05   0.05
    9 0.1    0.05

The first column denotes the sequential id, and the second and subsequent columns denote the parameter values for ``opt000`` and ``opt001`` in ``tleed4.i``.


Input file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the input file for the main program, ``input.toml``.
The details of ``input.toml`` can be found in the input file section of the manual.
The following is the content of ``input.toml`` in the sample file.

.. code-block::

    [base]
    dimension = 2
    output_dir = "output"
    
    [solver]
    name = "leed"
    [solver.config]
    path_to_solver = "./leedsatl/satl2.exe"
    [solver.reference]
    path_to_base_dir = "./base"
    
    [algorithm]
    name = "mapper"
    label_list = ["z1", "z2"]
    [algorithm.param]
    mesh_path = "./MeshData.txt"


First, ``[base]`` section is explained.

- ``dimension`` is the number of variables to be optimized. In this case, it is ``2`` since we are optimizing two variables as described in ``tleed4.i``.

- ``output_dir`` is the name of directory for the outputs. If it is omitted, the results are written in the directory in which the program is executed.

``[solver]`` section specifies the solver to be used inside the main program and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the solver you want to use. In this tutorial it is ``leed``.

The solver can be configured in the subsections ``[solver.config]`` and ``[solver.reference]``.

``[solver.config]`` section specifies options for reading the output file produced by ``satl2.exe`` that is called from the main program.

- ``path_to_solver`` is the command name of ``satl2.exe``. It is specified as a path to the executable file, or searched from the PATH environment variable.

``[solver.reference]`` section specifies the location of the experimental data and the range to read.

- ``path_to_base_dir`` specifies the path to the directory for the reference data.

``[algorithm]`` section specifies the algorithm to use and its settings.

- ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use. In this tutorial we will use ``mapper`` since we will be using grid-search method.

- ``label_list`` is a list of label names to be attached to the output of ``opt000`` and ``opt001``.

``[algorithm.param]`` section specifies the parameters for the search algorithm.

- ``mesh_path`` is the file name of the search grid.
  
For details on other parameters that can be specified in the input file, please see the Input File section of the manual.


Calculation execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample files are located. (We assume that you are directly under the directory where you downloaded this software.)

.. code-block::

   $ cd sample/mapper

Using ``setup.sh``, download and compile ``satleed``.

.. code-block::

   $ sh setup.sh

``satl1.exe`` and ``satl2.exe`` will be created in the directory ``leedsatl``.
Then, run the main program. The computation time will take only a few seconds on a normal PC.

.. code-block::

   $ mpiexec -np 4 py2dmat-leed input.toml | tee log.txt

Here, the calculation using MPI parallel with 4 processes will be done.
When executed, a folder for each MPI rank will be created in ``output``, and the results of the calculations are stored there.
The standard output will be shown like as follows.

.. code-block::

    Iteration : 1/33
    Read experiment.txt
    mesh before: [1.0, 6.0, 6.0]
    z1 =  6.00000
    z2 =  6.00000
    [' 6.00000', ' 6.00000']
    PASS : degree in lastline = 7.0
    PASS : len(calculated_list) 70 == len(convolution_I_calculated_list)70
    R-factor = 0.04785241875354398
    ...

``z1`` and ``z2`` are the candidate parameters for each mesh and ``R-factor`` is the function value at that point.
Finally, the ``R-factor`` calculated at all the points on the grid will be written to ``ColorMap.txt``.
In this case, the following results will be obtained.

.. code-block::

    -0.100000 0.000000 0.319700
    -0.050000 0.000000 0.212100
    0.000000 0.000000 0.189500
    0.050000 0.000000 0.502300
    0.100000 0.000000 0.941600
    -0.100000 0.050000 0.318600
    -0.050000 0.050000 0.206600
    0.000000 0.050000 0.190500
    0.050000 0.050000 0.506200
    0.100000 0.050000 0.933200
    ...

The first and second columns contain the values of ``opt000`` and ``opt001``, and the third column contains the ``R-factor``.

Note that ``do.sh`` is available as a script for batch calculation.
In ``do.sh``, the difference between ``ColorMap.dat`` and ``ref_ColorMap.dat`` is also examined.
Here is what it does, without further explanation.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh
   
    sh prepare.sh

    time mpiexec -np 4 py2dmat-leed input.toml

    echo diff output/ColorMap.txt ref_ColorMap.txt
    res=0
    diff output/ColorMap.txt ref_ColorMap.txt || res=$?
    if [ $res -eq 0 ]; then
      echo TEST PASS
      true
    else
      echo TEST FAILED: ColorMap.txt and ref_ColorMap.txt differ
      false
    fi


Visualization of calculation results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By plotting ``ColorMap.txt``, we can estimate the region where the value of ``R-factor`` becomes small.
In this case, the following command will create a two-dimensional parameter space diagram ``ColorMapFig.png``.

.. code-block::

   $ python3 plot_colormap_2d.py

Looking at the generated figure, we can see that it has the minimum value around (-0.02, Â±0.1).

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/mapper.*

   ``R-factor`` on a two-dimensional parameter space.
