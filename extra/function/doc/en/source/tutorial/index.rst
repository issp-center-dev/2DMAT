Tutorials
================================

In this tutorial, we will instruct how to use 2DMAT and 2DMAT-Functions modules, considering the minimization problem of Himmelblau function as an example.

For the inverse problem algorithm we adopt the grid search provided as ``mapper`` module. See the 2DMAT manual for other algorithms.
